# XML_Project

## Use Apache XMLBeans tool and JAXB to manipulate XML and Java Objects.
## Purpose:
1.	We want to infer a XML schema from an existing XML document.
2.	We want to programmatically manipulate the “DOM” objects in the XML so that we can programmatically modify, add, and delete information in the XML.

## Possible solution:
1.	We can use a utility to infer an XML schema from a XML file.
2.	Then we use another utility to generate programmable classes/objects from the inferred XML schema.
3.	We can then manipulate those classes/objects in computer memory.
4.	Finally, we use a utility to convert the manipulated objects back into an XML file.
